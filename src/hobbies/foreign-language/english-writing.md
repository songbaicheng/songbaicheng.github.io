# English Writing
## 书信
书信一般可以分为公函和私人信件两种大类，一般包括称呼、正文、敬辞、署名四个部分，以下篇为例。

```
Dear Sir or Madam

    I am writing for information about test preparation materials for 
the IELTS test.

    I wonder if you have a vocabulary book covering the words 
required for IELTS, as well as past examination papers with keys and 
model essays. Besides, how should I play for these book--by cash, 
cheque, or any other means? If possible, I would like to use my credit 
card. Finally, how will these books be shipped and when is the 
approximate time I can receive them? The express mail is preferable if 
the additional charge is not too much.

    I would appreciate it if you send me a reply at your earliest 
convenience.

                                                Yours sincerely,
                                                Li Ming
